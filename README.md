# Cute-Learning

Welcome to the **Cute-Learning** repository! This project showcases several example implementations using **Cutlass CuTe**, a powerful tool for high-performance computing.

## Features

This repository includes implementations for:

- **GEMM** (General Matrix Multiply)
- **GEMV** (General Matrix-Vector Multiply)
- **Flash-Decoding**
- **Data Copy**
- **LDSM** (ldmatrix instruction)
- **Tensor Dequant**
- **TODO...** (More features to come!)

## GEMM

The **GEMM** implementation is optimized for performance. Below is a performance graph showcasing its efficiency:
